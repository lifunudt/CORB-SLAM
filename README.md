## introduction

**CORB-SLAM(collaborative ORB-SLAM)** is a centralized multi-robot visual SLAM system based on  **[ORB_SLAM2[1-2]](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2)**.
The ORB-SLAM2 is a versatile and accurate visual SLAM method that has been popularly applied in single robot applications. However, this method cannot provide support to multi-robot cooperation in environmental mapping.
The CORB-SLAM system consists of multiple ORB_SLAM2 clients for local mapping and a central server for global map fusion. Specifically, we extend each of the ORB_SLAM2 clients with a memory managing module that organizes the local map and communicates with the central server. In the central server, we detect the overlaps of multiple local maps by the DBoW method, and fuse these maps by utilizing the PnP method and global optimization through bundle adjustment.

## 1. Prerequisites

### 1.0 requirements
  * ubuntu 14.04
  * ROS indigo
  * ORBSLAM2 1.0.0
  * boost

### 1.1 ROS install

Inatall ROS indigo according to the instructions in [ROS wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation).

### 1.2 ORBSLAM2 and its dependencies

Our CORB-SLAM system is build on the foundation of [ORB_SLAM2(https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2). You should follow the instructions provided by ORB_SLAM2 build its dependencies. We do not list here.

### 1.3 Boost library install
We use boost library to serialize and deserialize the data.
We can install boost library using the following instruction in terminal.
```bash
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev
```


### 2.1 build CORB-SLAM

The CORB-SLAM runs as the ROS package. and the CORB-SLAM *src* directory should be the ROS package directory, *catkin_src/*.
We use catkin tool to organize the CORB-SLAM packages, corbslam_client and corbslam_servcer.

Terminal in the *catkin_src/* directory.
```
catkin_make
catkin_install
```

### 2.2 run CORB-SLAM

#### 2.2.1 start ros core
```
roscore
```
#### 2.2.2 start corbslam_servcer
```
rosrun corbslam_servcer PATH_TO_VOCABULARY/ORBvoc.txt PATH_TO_CONFIGURATION/KITTIX.yaml
```
#### 2.2.3 run multiple corbslam_client in different datasets

1. run KITTI datasets

Download the dataset (grayscale images) from http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php

Execute the following command. Change `KITTIX.yaml`to KITTI00-02.yaml, KITTI03.yaml or KITTI04-12.yaml for sequence 0 to 2, 3, and 4 to 12 respectively. Change `PATH_TO_DATASET_FOLDER` to the uncompressed dataset folder. Change `SEQUENCE_NUMBER` to 00, 01, 02,.., 11.

```
rosrun corbslam_client_stereo_kitti corbslam_client_stereo_kitti Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/Stereo/KITTIX.yaml PATH_TO_DATASET_FOLDER CLIENT_ID
```
